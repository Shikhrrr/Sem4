Lab 4
LAN port -> 48 bit address
framing
	-header 32 bit
	-programming/burn done under Verilog (but done in C)
	-frame method - old tech: bit stuffing
		-problem: changing of data (when to start frame)
			old tech: byte stuffing -> 8 bit insertion
			problem = special characters to make starting 				and ending same
			byte stuff---DATA---byte stuff

1. bit stuffing
2. character stuffing
